## CAR RENTAL AND COORPORATION
Dbms project
## Objective
Car rental & co is an online application which is used to hire cars.
Car rental agencies primarily serve people who have a car that is temporarily out of reach or out of service, for example travellers who are out of town or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Because of the variety of sizes of their vehicles, car rental agencies may also serve the self- moving industry needs, by renting vans or trucks. Apart from this, people who travel to foreign country, for their transportation needs rent a car as it is cost efficient and comfortable.
language used is PHP.
why ony php?
PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor and is a server-side programming language.

There are many reasons to use PHP for server side programming; firstly it is a free language with no licensing fees so the cost of using it is minimal.
A good benefit of using PHP is that it can interact with many different database languages including MySQL. We work with MySQL at Bluelinemedia since this is also a free language so it makes sense to use PHP. Both PHP and MySQL are compatible with an Apache server which is also free to license. PHP can also run on Windows, Linux and UNIX servers.PHP also has very good online documentation with a good framework of functions in place. This makes the language relatively easy to learn and very well supported online. There are countless forums and tutorials on various PHP methods and problems so it is usually very easy to find help if you need it.
